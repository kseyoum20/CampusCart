## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
What went well this week is that we have been able to communicate much better than last week. We were also able to expand more on the design of our web application. We have made wireframes of more than three pages and designed an ERD.


### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One of the challenges we faced is that our team has once again changed because one of our teammates has withdrawn from the team. We hope to continue to work together and make a project we are proud of.
### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
No help needed so far
