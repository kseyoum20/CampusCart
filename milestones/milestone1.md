## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

What went well during this unit is our coordination in exploring various ideas, shortlisting to one feasable yet applicable one. 
We had to consider potential ideas and whether or not they were expansive enough for us to implement all the baseline features and some optional ones.
We finally settled on a university commerce platform for students to exchange their used and sellable utilities for some extra cash. We think this is a
fitting project for us to implement. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the biggest challenges was that our previous team mates withdrew from the course which ment that we were teamed up pretty late(the day of the deadline for this milestone). So we had to
communicate with eachother and make sure to submit our deliverables in time withing the given 72 hour extension. Moving on, we expect to be more cohesive and diligent with our tasks.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We may need some assistance inorder to adjust our pace, but no need for it thusfar. Thank you!
